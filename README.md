Hello, my name is Nancy. I'm want to write an app! because why the hell not right? Also I want to learn something new and challenge myself beyond just uni. Even though uni is already really hard. Kind of nervous tbh, I'm not sure if I'm putting too much onto my plate...
I guess we'll find out.

Fighting!

Out.
